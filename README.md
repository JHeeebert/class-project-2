# class-project-2 Portfolio
    As a class we were tasked with building a portfolio site from scrathc with no starter code! 

# Description
1. We took an image that showed a demo of a portfolio site and re created 
    it from scratch.

2. We started by laying out the HTML and getting the structure of my page
    built out. We then applied CSS using the flex box and grid properties.

3. I added some personal touches with avatars and backgrounds as well as    hovering features over links including one of my favorite features: the box links with a background image that fades to another picture using transition-property: background duration: 2s and timing=function: linear

4. Overall this was a fun project and I look forward to your feed back and adding to this portfolio as I progresss in my career. 


# Issues Faced During Project
1. Alignment on headers proved tricky and the second box and all- 
    content in general is not spaced correctly and I will look to fix- 
    as I get progress more in the bootcamp.
2. Refactoring code was a fun but daunting process, I spent alot -
    of hours reading the same things over and over trying to figure out-
    issues that I created but found the challenge fun and informative.
3. Deployment was a challenege because of the way I named the folders- 
    originally (using capital letters) I found out changing folder names-
    on GitHub can be tricky so I troubleshooted by making links in HTML- 
    match folder names with capitalization.
