# class-project-2 Portfolio
    As a class we were tasked with building a portfolio site from scratch with no starter code! 

# Description
1. We took an image that showed a demo of a portfolio site and re created 
    it from scratch.

2. We started by laying out the HTML and getting the structure of my page
    built out. We then applied CSS using the flex box and grid properties.

3. I added some personal touches with avatars and backgrounds as well as    hovering features over links including one of my favorite features: the box links with a background image that fades to another picture using transition-property: background duration: 2s and timing=function: linear

4. Overall this was a fun project and I look forward to your feed back and adding to this portfolio as I progresss in my career. 


# Issues Faced During Project
1. The box links in the middle of the page were the toughest part of this challenge for me with some help in office hours I was able to figure it out!

2. I had a ton of fun with this one and tried to make it as personalized as possible knowing I can use this to try to get jobs after the bootcamp and continue to add to it as I progress in my career.

3. Deployment this time worked fine and I feel more confident this time around with all the skills we used!
